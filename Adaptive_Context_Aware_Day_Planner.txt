ADAPTIVE CONTEXT-AWARE DAY PLANNER
=================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
The Adaptive Context-Aware Day Planner is a smart, real-world productivity application
that helps users plan and execute their day realistically.

Unlike traditional to-do or calendar applications, this system dynamically adapts a
user’s schedule based on time availability, energy levels, task priority, and real-time
changes, providing a more human and flexible approach to daily planning.

The application is implemented as a full-stack MERN application with a React Native
mobile companion, supporting real-time updates, analytics, and offline usage.



KEY OBJECTIVES
--------------
• Help users plan days that adapt to real-life changes
• Reduce unrealistic task overload
• Provide insights into time usage and productivity patterns
• Deliver a practical, everyday-use application with strong engineering depth



CORE FEATURES
-------------

1. Context-Based Planning
   - Days are divided into context blocks such as Morning Routine, Focus Work, Commute,
     and Evening.
   - Tasks belong to contexts instead of flat task lists.
   - Each context defines time limits, energy requirements, and flexibility rules.

2. Dynamic Day Rebalancing
   - Automatically adjusts schedules when tasks overrun.
   - Reschedules low-priority tasks intelligently.
   - Updates the day timeline in real time.

3. Energy-Aware Task Allocation
   - Users define personal energy levels (High / Medium / Low).
   - Tasks are matched to appropriate energy windows.
   - Prevents demanding tasks during low-energy periods.

4. Reality Mode
   - Displays only tasks that can realistically be done at the current moment.
   - Filters tasks based on available time, energy level, and context.

5. Daily Retrospective and Insights
   - End-of-day summary comparing planned vs completed tasks.
   - Context-wise time analysis.
   - Weekly and monthly productivity insights.

6. Offline-First Mobile Companion
   - Quick task and idea capture on mobile.
   - Offline support with automatic sync when online.
   - Lightweight daily planner interface.

7. Reports and Notifications
   - Daily or weekly email summaries.
   - Exportable productivity reports in PDF or CSV format.
   - Gentle reminders instead of intrusive notifications.



TECHNOLOGIES USED
-----------------

MongoDB
• Structured data models for users, days, contexts, tasks, and activity logs
• Aggregation pipelines for analytics and insights
• Change Streams for real-time schedule updates
• Sorting, limiting, and schema validation
• MongoDB Atlas for cloud storage and replication (conceptual)

Node.js and Express.js
• RESTful API architecture
• Middleware for authentication, planner logic, and error handling
• Session and cookie management
• Event-driven logic using Node Event Emitters
• Email notifications and scheduled jobs
• File handling for report exports
• Modular directory structure

React.js (Web Application)
• Component-based UI architecture
• Redux for global state management
• Dynamic timeline-based planner interface
• Routing for daily, weekly, and analytics views
• Real-time UI updates

React Native (Mobile Application)
• Cross-platform mobile application
• Offline task creation and synchronization
• Push notifications and reminders
• Shared backend with the web application



HOW THIS APP IS DIFFERENT
-------------------------

Traditional planners:
• Use static task lists
• Rely on fixed schedules
• Ignore user energy levels
• Require manual reviews
• Focus only on time

Adaptive Context-Aware Day Planner:
• Uses context-based dynamic planning
• Rebalances schedules in real time
• Matches tasks to energy levels
• Provides automated retrospectives
• Focuses on realistic daily execution



RESUME-READY DESCRIPTION
------------------------
Designed and developed a full-stack context-aware day planning application that
dynamically adapts daily schedules based on real-time constraints, energy levels,
and task priorities using the MERN stack and React Native.



WHY THIS PROJECT STANDS OUT
---------------------------
• Real-world, everyday usefulness
• Avoids typical to-do application design
• Demonstrates advanced backend concepts
• Covers most topics from the MERN and React Native syllabus
• Suitable for academic evaluation, interviews, and real deployment
